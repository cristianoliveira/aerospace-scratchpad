# aerospace-scratchpad

Here you will find extensive documentation about the CLI.

## Command: `move`

Move the currently focused window to the `.scratchpad` workspace. The window will be hidden until you show it again.
You can actually see this in your workspace list, but it can be ignoredâ€”it's just used to store windows that are "hidden".

### USAGE

`pattern` is a regex pattern to match the app name.

```bash
aerospace-scratchpad move <pattern>
```

For more details:
```bash
aerospace-scratchpad move --help
```

## Command: `show`

Similar to Sway's `show`, this command will:

 - Show a window that was previously moved to the scratchpad workspace.
 - Move the window to the scratchpad if it is focused and matches the `<pattern>`.
 - If a scratchpad window is in another workspace, it will move it to the current workspace.
 - If a scratchpad window is already in the current workspace, it will set focus on it.
 - If multiple windows match a pattern, it will bring all of them to the current workspace.
 - If no window matches a pattern, it will do nothing.

The `pattern` is a regex pattern to match the "App Name".

USAGE: `aerospace-scratchpad show <pattern>`

For more details:
```bash
aerospace-scratchpad show --help
```

## Command: `summon`

Unlike the `show` command, this command will only summon the window to the current workspace and set focus on it.

### USAGE

The `pattern` is a regex pattern to match the "App Name".

```bash
aerospace-scratchpad summon <pattern>
```

## Command: `next`

This command will summon the next window from the scratchpad workspace until there are no more windows to summon.

### USAGE

```bash
aerospace-scratchpad next
```

## Implementation details

### Scratchpad workspace

It will send the window to a "special" workspace called `.scratchpad`. This workspace is like any other workspace, but can be ignored. The window will be hidden until you show it again.

### Communication with AeroSpaceWM

The communication with AeroSpaceWM is done through an IPC socket client.
