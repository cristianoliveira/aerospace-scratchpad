# aerospace-scratchpad

Here you will find extensive documentation about the CLI.

## Command: `move`

Move the currently focused window to the `.scratchpad` workspace. The window will be hidden until you show it again.
You can actually see this in your workspace list, but it can be ignoredâ€”it's just used to store windows that are "hidden".

### USAGE

`pattern` is a regex pattern to match the app name.

```bash
aerospace-scratchpad move <pattern>
```

For more details:
```bash
aerospace-scratchpad move --help
```

See also [flags](#flags).

## Command: `show`

Similar to Sway's `show`, this command will:

 - Show a window that was previously moved to the scratchpad workspace.
 - Move the window to the scratchpad if it is focused and matches the `<pattern>`.
 - If a scratchpad window is in another workspace, it will move it to the current workspace.
 - If a scratchpad window is already in the current workspace, it will set focus on it.
 - If multiple windows match a pattern, it will bring all of them to the current workspace.
 - If no window matches a pattern, it will do nothing.

The `pattern` is a regex pattern to match the "App Name".

USAGE: `aerospace-scratchpad show <pattern>`

For more details:
```bash
aerospace-scratchpad show --help
```

See also [flags](#flags).

## Command: `summon`

Unlike the `show` command, this command will only summon the window to the current workspace and set focus on it.

### USAGE

The `pattern` is a regex pattern to match the "App Name".

```bash
aerospace-scratchpad summon <pattern>
```

See also [flags](#flags).

## Command: `next`

This command will summon the next window from the scratchpad workspace until there are no more windows to summon.

### USAGE

```bash
aerospace-scratchpad next
```

## Command: `workspace-handler`

This command handles when the scratchpad workspace gets focused (which shouldn't happen). It will move focus back to the last focused workspace and take the focused window to that workspace too.
This allow you to use different tools to focus windows in scratchpad, like notifications, external launchers, etc., and behave as "summoning" the window to the current workspace instead of focusing the window
in the scratchpad workspace.

### USAGE

`aerospace-scratchpad workspace-handler <workspace>`

For more details:

```bash
aerospace-scratchpad workspace-handler --help
```

Add this snippet in your `~/.aerospace.toml` config:
```toml
exec-on-workspace-change = ['/bin/bash', '-c',
    'aerospace-scratchpad workspace-handler $AEROSPACE_FOCUSED_WORKSPACE'
]
```
You can also use the short alias `ws-handler` or `wsh`.

## Flags

### Filter `--filter|-F <property>=<regex>` 

_min version: 0.2.0_

The filter flag helps to narrow down the windows that will be shown. It accepts a property and a regex pattern to match against that property. It can be used multiple time with different properties to narrow down the window matching.

For example, to filter by class and title, you can use:

```bash
aerospace-scratchpad show Brave -F window-title=Gmail -F window-title="personal"
# Bring all Brave windows with title containing "Gmail" AND "personal" to the current workspace.

aerospace-scratchpad show Terminal --filter window-title=kitty
# Bring all Terminal windows with title containing "kitty" to the current workspace.

aerospace-scratchpad show Kitty -F window-title='(?i)kitty.*work'
# Bring all windows with title matching the regex (Case insensitive) "kitty.*work" to the current workspace. Eg. "kitty work", "kitty work project", "KITTY more WORK", etc

## Example on how to use only window filter (We may allow empty patterns in the future)
aerospace-scratchpad show . --filter window-title=kitty
# Match all windows and filter the ones with title containing "kitty" bringing to the current workspace.
```

Current allowed properties for filtering are:

    - *window-id*: The ID of the window.
    - *window-title*: The title of the window. 
    - *app-name*: The name of the application. E.g. `Terminal`, `Brave`, etc.
    - *app-bundle-id*: The bundle ID of the application. E.g. `com.apple.Terminal`.

It fails if the property is not recognized or if the regex pattern is invalid.

### Dry Run `--dry-run|-n`

_min version: 0.2.0_

This flag will not execute the command, but will print what would be done. Very handy to test your command before adding to your
config file.

Usage:
```bash
aerospace-scratchpad --dry-run show <pattern>
```

It will print the actions that would be taken, but will not execute them.

## Implementation details

### Scratchpad workspace

It will send the window to a "special" workspace called `.scratchpad`. This workspace is like any other workspace, but can be ignored. The window will be hidden until you show it again.

### Communication with AeroSpaceWM

The communication with AeroSpaceWM is done through an IPC socket client.
